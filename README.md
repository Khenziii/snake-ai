## snake-ai
snake-ai is an extensible and customizable snake game; that offers a CLI & supports training neural networks.

### Features
- CLI - A decent part of this project is its command line interface. It allows you to work more easily & gives you access to a bunch of useful perks (such as being able to change snake's color while the game is running). To list all available commands use the `help` command. ![Video showcasing CLI](https://github.com/Khenziii/snake-ai/assets/126098761/04e4ddc7-174c-4617-88ad-d94130e8e7a9)
- Game - The snake game itself is created using pygame. It's cleanly written and open for extension.
- Plotter - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is being used to show nice graphs of achieved scores.
- AI - You can train, save and load neural networks at almost no effort. CLI and plotter make it convenient to track progress of your models.
- Config - thanks to the [config module](https://github.com/Khenziii/snake-ai/blob/master/config/config.py), a lot of settings can be managed directly from a .json file.
